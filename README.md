I have a passion for storytelling and science, especially astronomy.
Always outdoors as a kid, I spent my time exploring the creeks and hills of eastern Kansas. 
I marveled at the fossils, limestone caves, intense thunderstorms and a starry sky created by a life away from the city. 
I used to sit back in the hay as a kid learning all the constellations and anticipating a few satellites sail overhead. 
I fell in love with the stories I heard about the sky. Ultimately, what I found was a knack and joy in sharing those stories with others.

From interviewing and writing, photography and illustration, creative coding and data visualization, 
my goal is to draw someone in with awe and delight and make an impression in their busy day.
Being a Creative Technologist/Polymath allows me to be an important part of that chain of creating exciting content and cultivating wonder. 

I wield the power of creation with strong writing and storytelling, deep Photoshop and graphic design skills, 
web development and creative coding across a wide range of technologies. 
My design style is characterized by a strong visual expression; my writing is more conversational in nature. 
I want you to learn quickly and completely what I want you to know and be excited by what you read. 
I love solving problems, creating every day, and staying brave and curious.

This past May, I finished a Master’s in Creative Technologies (within the University of Colorado Boulder School of Engineering). 
My emphasis focuses not only on the awe and delight but also storytelling and cultivating the adjacent possible within myself and those around me. 
My goal is to bring wonder into learning and instill a sense of awe about the world in which we live. We thrived as kids with that fuel. 
I want to awaken with my audiences. With that foundation and an entrepreneurial spirit, I build interactive experiences designed to delight.
